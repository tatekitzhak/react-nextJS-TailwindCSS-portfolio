    "headerTaglineOne": "Dining on Ethiopian cultural food is characterized by the ritual of breaking 'injera' and sharing food from a common plate, signifying the bonds of loyalty and friendship. The traditional way of eating is with fingers. 'Injera' is placed on the plate with variety of dishes decoratively arranged around it. A small portion of 'Injera' is torn off and wrapped around a mouthful of the selected dish. 'Injera', our staple bread, is a flat bread made of 'Teff', a fine grain unique to Ethiopia. 'Wot' is dipping sauce which maybe prepared using a variety of meats, fish, and vegetables. 'Wot' is cooked with 'Berbere' (Ethiopian seasoning prepared from matured red chili pepper and other exotic spices) which may range from very mild to spicy hot. 'Alitcha' is more mildly spiced dipping sauce prepared with a variety of meats or vegetables. Ethiopian cultural dishes are prepared with a distinctive variety of unique spices for an unforgettably striking dimension to exotic cookery. To help you make the best of choice for this truly different and exciting dinning experience we offer the following descriptions:",
